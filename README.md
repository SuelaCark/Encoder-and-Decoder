# Encoder-and-Decoder
### Project description:
The Encoder and Decoder project creates a program which allows the user to encrypt plain text and/or 
decrypt encrypted text. The program encrypts and decrypts text by using Ciphers. Currently, there
are three ciphers available: Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and Vignere Cipher. 

The main aims of this program are the following:
* To help teach others about ciphers, encryption, and decryption
* To encrypt and decrypt messages and/or passwords which will allow to have an additional basic 
level of security
* To entertain new computer scientists, teach them that coding is fun, and motivate them to learn 
more about the real-life implementation of coding projects

  
* What my application does,
* The challenges I faced and features I hope to implement in the future.
